**PhyloGen**

PhyloGen is an intuitive web app intended to make the construction of phylogenetic trees from protein or DNA sequences easy. Developed using Streamlit and based on strong BioPython libraries as well as on commonly used alignment programs such as MAFFT, MUSCLE, ClustalW and TCoffee, PhyloGen (via EMBL API) enables everyone—no coding experience required—to study genetic associations through an organized, visualized interface. Fundamentally, PhyloGen facilitates the upload of FASTA files with three or more sequences. Upon upload, sequence information can be previewed, and the sequence type (DNA or Protein) can be chosen. The application then provides an option for a variety of multiple sequence alignment algorithms, each of which has user-definable parameters such as gap opening and extension penalties. PhyloGen implements distance-based algorithms (Neighbour Joining, UPGMA) as well as character-based algorithms (Maximum Parsimony, Maximum Likelihood through FastTree) to build trees. PhyloGen also offers a range of substitution models to achieve precise distance computation and evolutionary inference. The web application graphically displays the resultant phylogenetic tree with Matplotlib, where users can also download the tree as a high-quality PNG. Users can further export aligned sequences in FASTA format and tree data in Newick format, which makes the tool ideal both for publication as well as downstream analysis. With clean looks, interactive controls, and educational emphasis, PhyloGen is perfect for students, researchers, and teachers seeking a fast, precise, and easy-to-use method of exploring evolutionary relationships. The tool's modular architecture facilitates effortless updates, with plans in the future to include session saving, database integration, and sophisticated tree editing.
